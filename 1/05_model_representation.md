# Week 1 - Model Representation

## Reminders about what kinds of problems exist:

* ***Supervised*** a machine learning paradigm wherein we provide known data sets ("training sets") and try to "learn" solutions from them.
* ***Unsupervised*** a machine learning paradigm wherein we provide data to an algorithm and let the algorithm find patters in it without outside help

## Notation used in this course

* ***m*** the number of training examples
* ***x*** s input variables ("features")
* ***y*** s output variables ("target" variables)
* ***(x, y)*** a single training example
* ***(x<sup>(i)</sup>, y<sup>(i)</sup>)*** the *i*th training example
