# Week 1 - Unsupervised Learning

### Definitions
* ***Unsupervised learning*** a machine learning paradigm in which we try to find a solution to a problem without knowing in advance any "correct" answer against which to compare our solution. This takes the form of clustering (e.g., how news stories should be groupled).
* ***Cocktail party problem*** a problem in which we must separate the voices in a given recording using two microphones
